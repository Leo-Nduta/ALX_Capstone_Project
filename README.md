This project is the backend for a public transport app
It allows users to gain knowledge in advance on fare estimates depending on base or peak times, available saccos and the different stages.
Stages are divided into zones which is the basis on which fares are determined since fare from zone  to zone 4 cannot be the same as from zone 2 to 3
This project is designed specifically for the Ngong-Nairobi route

Features include:
    user registration
    login
    stage and zone management
    peak and off-peak fare handling
    available saccos
    admin only management of fares and stages
    alighting and destination stages implementation

peak hours are from 6 to 10AM and 4 to 8PM

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
    GPS based nearest stage detection
    multi modal recommendations
    Nationwide coverage
